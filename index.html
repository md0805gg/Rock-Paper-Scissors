<!--
My questions  / thoughts:
1. write a function
2. try to understand order in which above function would be run
3. try to understand best scope choice
4. variable inside or outside of the function?

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beat paper
Paper beats Rock

scissors 

x2 because of the other way around

tie
r r
s s
p p

you win:
p:r

r:r
r:p
r:s
p:r
p:p
p:s
s:r
s:p
s:s


w: r:s, p:r, s:p
l: r:p, p:s, s:r
t: r:r, p:p, s:s

function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
  // your code here!
}
 
const playerSelection = "rock";
const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));
